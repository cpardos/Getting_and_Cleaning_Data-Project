# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
This repositoy is for the project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course of Coursera.

##Raw Data
The data comes from a Samsung data base. All the files and variables that I have used for the project, in addition to all the transformations done, are explained in the CodeBook.md.

##Script in R
Look at run.analysis.R in order to find all the code needed to reproduce what I have done to create the final output TidyData_averages.txt (also included in the repository).
In order to follow all the steps you will need to download the data in your working directory.
